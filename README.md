# ENS Sights Project

Welcome to ENS Sights, a project dedicated to providing detailed insights into Ethereum Name Service (ENS) holdings using the ENS subgraph explorer. Our goal is to go beyond the basic functionalities offered by the main ENS website and deliver comprehensive information, including subdomains, expiration dates, and last prices.

## Features

- **Holder Information:** Discover who holds a particular ENS.
- **Subdomain Details:** Explore subdomains associated with the ENS.
- **Expiration Dates:** Find out when a specific ENS is set to expire.
- **Last Prices:** Obtain information about the last recorded prices.

## Why ENS Sights?

The main ENS website primarily focuses on the availability of ENS, providing limited information. ENS Sights aims to be the first project to offer in-depth insights into ENS holdings. By leveraging the power of The Graph, we provide a more comprehensive view for users interested in detailed ENS analytics.
